    """Transforms sequences to graphs that encode secondary structure information

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequences : iterable
        iterable pairs of header and sequence strings

    shape_type : int (default 5)
        Is the level of abstraction or dissimilarity which defines a different shape.
        In general, helical regions are depicted by a pair of opening and closing brackets
        and unpaired regions are represented as a single underscore. The differences of the
        shape types are due to whether a structural element (bulge loop, internal loop, multiloop,
        hairpin loop, stacking region and external loop) contributes to the shape representation:
        Five types are implemented.
        1   Most accurate - all loops and all unpaired  [_[_[]]_[_[]_]]_
        2   Nesting pattern for all loop types and unpaired regions in external loop
        and multiloop [[_[]][_[]_]]
        3   Nesting pattern for all loop types but no unpaired regions [[[]][[]]]
        4   Helix nesting pattern in external loop and multiloop [[][[]]]
        5   Most abstract - helix nesting pattern and no unpaired regions [[][]]

    energy_range : float (default 10)
        Sets the energy range as percentage value of the minimum free energy.
        For example, when relative deviation is specified as 5.0, and the minimum free energy
        is -10.0 kcal/mol, the energy range is set to -9.5 to -10.0 kcal/mol.
        Relative deviation must be a positive floating point number; by default it is set to to 10 %.

    max_num : int (default 3)
        Is the maximum number of structures that are generated.

    split_components : bool (default False)
        If True each structure is yielded as an independent graph. Otherwise all structures
        are part of the same graph that has therefore several disconnectd components.
